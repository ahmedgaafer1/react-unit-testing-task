# Cat Adoption App

This project is a simple cat adoption management application, consisting of two main parts:

- **client/**: Frontend (React)
- **server/**: Backend API (Node.js/Express)

## Getting Started

### 1. Start the Server (Backend)

- Navigate to the `server` directory
- Install dependencies:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Start the server:
  ```
  npm start
  ```
- The server will run by default at http://localhost:4000

### 2. Start the Client (Frontend)

- Navigate to the `client` directory
- Install dependencies:
  ```
  yarn install
  ```
- Start the React app:
  ```
  yarn start
  ```
- The app will run by default at http://localhost:3000

## Notes

- Each part contains its own README file (`client/README.md` and `server/README.md`) with more details.
- Make sure to start the server before running the frontend for full functionality.
